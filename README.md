# **Welcome to RN Sisal Word ðŸ‘‹**

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [create-expo-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). RN Sisal Word is a React Native app for OCR-based text recognition, voice-to-text, and manual text translation with Firebase integration.

## **Get Started**

1. **Install dependencies**

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

2. **Start the app**

   \`\`\`bash
   npx expo start
   \`\`\`

Youâ€™ll see options to open the app in:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for app development with Expo.

## **Features**

- **Camera-based OCR**  
  Capture images, extract text using OCR (\`@react-native-ml-kit/text-recognition\`), translate the text, and save it to Firebase.

- **Voice-to-Text Translation**  
  Use the voice-to-text functionality (\`@react-native-voice/voice\`) to translate spoken words and save them.

- **Manual Text Translation**  
  Manually input text, translate it, and store translations in Firebase for future reference.

- **Firebase Integration**  
  - User authentication (login and registration) via **Firebase Authentication**.
  - Save translations and manage user data in **Firebase Realtime Database**.
